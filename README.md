#Requirements:
- Using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript create a single page website that contains the following:
- A Bootstrap styled table representing your choice of data.
- A Bootstrap styled form that allows a user to add a new row to the table when clicking on submit.

## Issues: 
- I couldn't pass the id from the row into the button
- I couldn't append the button in the new rows in the switch statement
    - it was putting it to the right of the cell
